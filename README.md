# Obesity-Disease-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-Approach
This project focuses on detecting and predicting obesity risks using machine learning techniques. By analyzing health, lifestyle, and demographic data, models like SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost were implemented, with SVM achieving the best accuracy of 96.44%. The project includes a user-friendly desktop GUI that allows real-time data input and predictions, making it accessible for healthcare providers and individuals. Future directions include integrating wearable data for dynamic health monitoring and personalized intervention strategies.

## Flow of the Project

#### Data Collection
Gathered data from multiple sources.
Anonymized and cleaned the dataset.

#### Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed data to identify trends and relationships.
Visualized obesity-related factors like activity levels and eating habits.

#### Feature Engineering
Selected key features influencing obesity prediction.

#### Model Development
Trained machine learning models (SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost).
Evaluated performance using accuracy and precision metrics.

#### GUI Development
Built a user-friendly desktop interface for real-time data input and predictions.

#### Evaluation and Insights
Validated model predictions with unseen data.
Generated actionable insights for obesity risk reduction.

## How to Use

#### Data Collection: 
Gather your dataset and ensure it is cleaned and formatted correctly.
#### Exploratory Data Analysis:
Use sypder/ Jupyter notebook to analyze the dataset and identify patterns.
#### Model Training:
Follow the notebook instructions to train the machine learning model, fine-tuning parameters as needed.
#### Evaluation:
Use the model to predict obesity levels and interpret probabilities for better health insights.
