# Obesity-Disease-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-Approach
This project predicts obesity risks using SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with SVM achieving 96.44% accuracy. It features a GUI for real-time data input and predictions, aiming to assist healthcare providers and individuals in early detection and intervention.

## Flow of the Project

#### Data Collection
Gathered data from multiple sources.
Anonymized and cleaned the dataset.

#### Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed data to identify trends and relationships.
Visualized obesity-related factors like activity levels and eating habits.

#### Feature Engineering
Selected key features influencing obesity prediction.

#### Model Development
Trained machine learning models (SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost).
Evaluated performance using accuracy and precision metrics.

#### GUI Development
Built a user-friendly desktop interface for real-time data input and predictions.

#### Evaluation and Insights
Validated model predictions with unseen data.
Generated actionable insights for obesity risk reduction.

## How to Use
#### Data Collection: 
Gather your dataset and ensure it is cleaned and formatted correctly.
#### Exploratory Data Analysis:
Use sypder/ Jupyter notebook to analyze the dataset and identify patterns.
#### Model Training:
Follow the notebook instructions to train the machine learning model, fine-tuning parameters as needed.
#### Evaluation:
Use the model to predict obesity levels and interpret probabilities for better health insights.
